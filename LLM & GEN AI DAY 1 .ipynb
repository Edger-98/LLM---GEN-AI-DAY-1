Each day unfolded like a well-worn tapestry: breakfast, sunbathing, a nap, chasing a dust bunny, dinner, and then a long, luxurious grooming session before bed. But today, a stray breeze carried a scent, a whisper of something different, somethingâ€¦ exciting. It was the scent of adventure.\n\nThe scent led Barnaby to the back door, where a curious sight awaited him. A cardboard box, large enough for him to curl up in, sat nestled beside the overflowing bin. The cardboard had a faint aroma of cinnamon and pine, and Barnaby felt an irresistible urge to explore.\n\nWith a flick of his tail and a confident prance, Barnaby leaped onto the box. The world tilted, and then he was inside, the cardboard walls a comforting cocoon around him. The scent intensified, mingling with the smell of dust and damp earth. He knew this was no ordinary box. It was a portal to somewhere new.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the garden, Barnaby emerged from his cardboard vessel. He found himself in a vast, open space, a world of towering blades of grass and whispering leaves. The scent of adventure swirled around him, thick and intoxicating.\n\nA tiny creature, brown and furry, with big, curious eyes, scurried across the grass. Barnaby, ever the hunter, instinctively crouched low, his claws extended. But something about the creature's wide-eyed innocence stopped him. He let out a soft meow instead, a sound of greeting rather than threat.\n\nThe creature, a mouse, seemed surprised by the cat's lack of aggression. It squeaked a reply, and for a moment, they stared at each other, two unlikely companions in this strange, new world.\n\nThe mouse led Barnaby on a journey through the tall grass, past buzzing bees and chirping crickets. They crossed a babbling brook, the cool water lapping at their paws. Barnaby learned the mouse's name was Pip, and he discovered that Pip, despite his small size, possessed a heart full of courage and a knowledge of the world that Barnaby had never known.\n\nAs the moon rose high in the sky, casting a silvery glow on the grass, Barnaby knew it was time to return. He bid farewell to Pip, a pang of sadness in his heart. With a final glance back at his new friend, he turned and found himself back in the garden, the cardboard box lying empty next to the overflowing bin.\n\nBarnaby curled up in his favorite spot, the familiar warmth of the house a comforting embrace. But something had changed. The world felt bigger now, filled with the whispers of adventure and the memory of a new friend. He knew that though he was back to his routine, he would always carry the thrill of the journey, and the unlikely friendship that had bloomed in the heart of a cardboard box, within him. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = genai.GenerativeModel(\n    'gemini-1.5-flash-001',\n    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(\n        temperature=0.1,\n        top_p=1,\n        max_output_tokens=5,\n    ))\n\nzero_shot_prompt = \"\"\"Classify movie reviews as POSITIVE, NEUTRAL or NEGATIVE.\nReview: \"Her\" is a disturbing study revealing the direction\nhumanity is headed if AI is allowed to keep evolving,\nunchecked.
